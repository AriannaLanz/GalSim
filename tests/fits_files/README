Dr. Mark Calabretta gave us (MJ -- private communication) the OK to include 
them in the GalSim distribution, so thanks very much to him for making these
available to us to use for unit tests!  From Mark:

    I'm happy for you to include whichever test files you want with
    the GalSim package.

I checked with the IRSA Help Desk about bundling it (Issue #402:

and they said that it was fine to use this image with the following credit:

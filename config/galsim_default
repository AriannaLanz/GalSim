# --- PSF_type ---
#
# Specify the PSF type(s) for the simulated galaxy images; placing a None object as the first entry
# tells GalSim to expect this type information to come from the input catalogue.
#
# Currently available PSF_types are:
#
# "Gaussian"         A Gaussian light distribution.
# "DoubleGaussian"   A sum of two Gaussians found to provide a reasonable empirical fit to ground-
#                    based PSFs.
# "Moffat"           A Moffat (1969) parametric PSF model.
# "Airy"             An Airy function describing ideal diffraction limited optics.
# "OpticalPSF"       A PSF describing telescope optics with coma, astigmatism, defocus and spherical#                    aberration.
# "Pixel"            A square boxcar convolution that describes pixelation / pixel flux integration.
#
# Each of these PSF types has it's own set of input parameters, which must be set for each output
# object via input catalogue values, or given a specified distribution via config file.  See the
# GalSim object docstrings / GalSim documentation for details.
#
# More than one PSF can be specified via adding multiple entries to the list below; the resulting
# PSF in the output image will be the convolution of all entries in the list.

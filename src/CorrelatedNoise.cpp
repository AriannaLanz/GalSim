 * There are three levels of verbosity which can be helpful when debugging, which are written as
 * dbg, xdbg, xxdbg (all defined in Std.h).
 * It's Mike's way to have debug statements in the code that are really easy to turn on and off.
 *
 * If DEBUGLOGGING is #defined, then these write out to *dbgout, according to the value of 
 * verbose_level.
 * dbg requires verbose_level >= 1
 * xdbg requires verbose_level >= 2
 * xxdbg requires verbose_level >= 3
 * If DEBUGLOGGING is not defined, the all three becomes just `if (false) std::cerr`,
 * so the compiler parses the statement fine, but trivially optimizes the code away, so there is no
 * efficiency hit from leaving them in the code.

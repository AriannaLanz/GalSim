Process for updating fink with a new version:

- Download the tagged tarball from GitHub.
- Get the md5sum value for it.
- Update the galsim.info file with the new URL and new Source-MD5 value.
  (I keep these named by version number, but fink likes them as just galsim.info.)
- Make sure the SourceRename value matches the directory name in the tarball.
- Update /sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo/galsim.info link to point to new info file.
- fink validate galsim.info
- fink -m --build-as-nobody rebuild galsim
- dpkg -c /sw/fink/debs/galsim_0.3-1_darwin-i386.deb
- fink validate /sw/fink/debs/galsim_0.3-1_darwin-i386.deb
- fink install galsim
- git add new info file for this version.
- Submit to: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=17203&atid=414256
  - Don't forget to change the name to galsim.info (without the version number).
  - Group = Undergoing Validation

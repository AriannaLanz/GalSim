Documentation for the FITS and Image classes.

Kinds of objects the user will deal with:

FITSFile  is a FITS file.  FITS.h/cpp automatically keeps track of
number of opened files so they don't exceed CFITSIO maximum.  User
can create arbitrary number of FITSFile objects and not worry about
it.   A FITSFile can of course contain many HDU's (images), so
FITSFile has methods to ask how many and what type are there.
Opening multiple FITSFile classes that are referrals to the same file
is permissible (CFITSIO can do this), but if you try anything tricky
about conflicting permissions (e.g. one readonly and one overwrite),
there is no gaurantee what will happen.

FITSImage<class T> refers to a single image (HDU) in a FITS
file.  Each FITSImage has a memory buffering system that is
transparent to the user (see FITSImage.h for more).  All or part of
the FITSImage can be copied to an Image<T> structure using the
FITSImage.extract() method.  This data then has no connection to that
on the FITS disk file.  Alternatively one can call the FITSImage.use()
method to get an Image<T> that is tied to the disk data: any changes to
the Image<T> are automatically written back to the disk version.
If the FITSImage is read-only, then it should be const, and Image<T>
acquired by use() method are also const.  For a writable FITSImage,
one can write() an existing Image<T> into the disk version.

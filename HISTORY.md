Below is a history of tagged versions of GalSim called `vX.X`.  All tags of the form
`milestoneN` were from earlier stages of development and are not currently recommended for use.

v0.2
----

Major changes from v0.1:

* Significant revamping and commenting of demos, including both python and config versions (Issues
  243, 285, 289).

* Removed scipy dependence from the lensing engine, replacing it with functions from the integ
  package which are now exposed at the python layer (Issues 288, 291).

* Fixed some bugs in Image handling, and made Image handling generally more robust (Issues 293,
  294).

* Significant expansion in `config` functionality, using YAML/JSON format config files (Issues 291,
  295).

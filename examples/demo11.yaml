# Define the PSF profile

    # file and interpolate between the pixels with type = InterpolatedImage.

    # The only required parameter is the name of the file with the image.  Note: the file is

    # If the fits file has a scale given in the header information, we can use that for 
    # the pixel scale.  If it is not given it will assume 1. 
    # Or we can also override that by providing an explicit pixel scale here.
    # This file is a real SDSS PSF, which means pixel scale of 0.396 arcsec.  However, the 
    # typical seeing is 1.2 arcsec and we want to simulate better seeing, so we will just 
    # tell GalSim that the pixel scale is 0.2 arcsec to match the pixel scale we use below.

        # When whitening the image (see image.noise.whiten below), we need to make sure the
        # original correlated noise is present throughout the whole image, otherwise the
        # whitening will do the wrong thing to the parts of the image that don't include the
        # original image.  The RealGalaxy stores the correct noise profile to use, but we
        # need to tell it how large to pad with this noise.  This is a bit complicated for
        # the code to figure out on its own, especially with the possibility of compound
        # objects, dilations, shears, etc.  So we require the user to provide the size with
        # the noise_pad_size parameter.
        #
        # In this case, the postage stamp will be 32 arcsec for the undilated galaxies.
        # We expand the postage stamp as we dilate the galaxies, so that factor doesn't 
        # come into play here.  The shear and magnification are not significant, but the 
        # image can be rotated, which adds an extra factor of sqrt(2). So the net required 
        # padded size is
        #     noise_pad_size = 32 * sqrt(2) * 0.2 arcsec/pixel = 9.1 arcsec

    # This time we use stamp_size to set the size of the postage stamps.  In demo9, we left 
    # it out, so GalSim automatically determined a good size for each object. That's usually 
    # fine, but here we want to scale the stamp size by the same dilation we used for the 
    # galaxies.  This makes sure the noise padding used for the RealGalaxy is large enough 
    # that the whitening process whitens the entire postage stamp correctly.
    #
    # To access the value of the dilation for the current galaxy, we use a new type: Current.
    # This lets you access current values of other keys in the config file.  In this case,
    # we want gal.dilation, which accesses the current value of that key for each galaxy.
    #
    # We couple this with Eval to perform a calculation of the stamp size that matches the 
    # calculation in the python script, where we wanted the size to be odd to make it easier
    # to deal with the image offsets:

    # The default convention on positions is to follow the FITS standard where the lower left
    # pixel is called (1,1).  However, this can be counter-intuitive to people more used
    # to C or python indexing, where indices start at 0.  So we offer the option of switching
    # the indexing convention.  This is probably only  useful if you are going to do something 
    # non-trivial with the image_pos values.
    # 
    # If index_convention is 0 or 'C' or 'python', then the lower-left pixel is (0,0).
    # If index_convention is 1 or 'Fortran' or 'FITS', then the lower-left pixel is (1,1).
    # The default is 1.
    index_convention : 0

    # In demo9, we said that you can specify either image_pos or world_pos to place
    # each postage stamp on the full image.  If you don't specify either one, then the 
    # default is random x and y within the full image.

    #     min : 1 , max : {x,y}size 


    # Add Gaussian noise.  When using the whitening feature, the whitening process will end
    # up with white Gaussian noise.  So adding more Gaussian noise can be done coherently.
    # Adding any other kind of noise (Poisson for instance) will actually result in some 
    # Gaussian noise as well, with the total variance preserved.
    noise :
        type : Gaussian
        variance : 1.0e4   # Total variance including whatever the whitening process needs.

        # RealGalaxy objects have some noise already included in the original HST images.  
        # This noise is stored with each object, and the propagated through all changes
        # (transformations, convolutions, etc.), which will correlate the noise.
        #
        # Once the process gets to the point of adding additional noise to the image, you
        # have a few options for what to do with this propagated noise.  The first option
        # is to do nothing, in which case GalSim will just ignore it and add the full 
        # amount specified above as additional noise.  This is equivalent to treating the
        # noise that was in the original image as part of the true surface brightness
        # profile of the galaxy.
        #
        # Another option is to whiten the noise to get rid of the correlations.  This is
        # specified as whiten : True.  GalSim will add enough correlated noise to make the
        # resulting noise be white, then add more white noise to make the total variance 
        # equal to the above specified value.
        # 
        # However, this is often overkill for many applications.  If it is acceptable to 
        # merely end up with noise with some degree of symmetry (say 4-fold or 8-fold
        # symmetry), then you can instead have GalSim just add enough noise to make the
        # resulting noise have this kind of symmetry.  Usually this requires adding 
        # significantly less additional noise, which means you can have the resulting 
        # total variance be somewhat smaller.  The above specified variance will then 
        # correspond to the zero-lag value, since the noise will still have some 
        # covariances.  This option is specified using symmetrize : N, where N is the
        # order of the symmetry that is desired.  We use 8-fold symmetry here.

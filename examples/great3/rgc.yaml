# The Great3 real-ground-constant branch configuration file
# Note: This configuration will not produce images _identical_ to the ones used for Great3, 
# since the order of random number generation is different.  However, it is intended to
# produce an _equivalent_ simulation as the one produced for Great3.

# The real-galaxy branch is almost identical to the control branch.  So rather than duplicate
# everything from cgc.yaml and change a couple items, we use the template feature of GalSim
# config.

# This copies over everything from cgc.yaml
template : cgc.yaml

# Now we can change the things we need to change:

# 1. Use real galaxies rather than parametric
gal.first.gal_type : real

# 2. Whiten the noise from the HST images.
image.noise.whiten : True

# 3. Change the output directory
output.dir : real/ground/constant

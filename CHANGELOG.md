Changes from v1.0 to v1.1:
--------------------------

* Permit users to initialize OpticalPSF with a list or array of aberrations, as an alternative to
  specifying each one individually.  (The innards of OpticalPSF were also rearranged to use arrays
  instead of individual values, but this is not important for users, just developers.)

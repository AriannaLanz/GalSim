Changes from v0.4 to current version:
------------------------------------

* Added the ability to draw lensing shears and convergences self-consistently
  from the same input shear power spectrum.  (Issue #304)

* Added a utility that can take an input set of shears on a grid, and
  reconstruct the convergence.  (Issue #304)

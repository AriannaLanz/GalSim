Changes from v1.2 to v1.3
=========================


New Features
------------

- Updated CorrelatedNoise to work with images that have a non-trivial WCS. (#501)
- Added new methods of the image class to simulate detector effects:
  inter-pixel capacitance (#555) and image quantization (#558).
- Added information about PSF size and shape to the data structure that is
  returned by EstimateShear(). (#612)
- Added Spergel(2010) profile GSObject (#616).
- Added an option to the ChromaticObject class that allows for image rendering
  via interpolation between stored images.  This option can speed up the image
  rendering process compared to brute force evaluation for chromatic objects
  with basic properties that are wavelength-dependent. (#618)
- Added new `ChromaticAiry` and `ChromaticOpticalPSF` classes for representing
  optical PSFs.  These new classes allow the diffraction effects and (in the 
  latter case) aberrations to be wavelength-dependent. (#618)
- Enable initializing a DES_PSFEx object using a pyfits HDU directly instead
  of a filename. (#626)
- Added TopHat class implementing a circular tophat profile. (#639)


Deprecated Features
-------------------

- Deprecated CorrelatedNoise.calculateCovarianceMatrix, since it is not used anywhere. (#630)


Bug Fixes and Improvements
--------------------------

- Fixed a bug in UncorrelatedNoise where the variance was set incorrectly. (#630)
- Changed the implementation of drawing Box and Pixel profiles in real space
  (i.e. without being convolved by anything) to actually draw the surface 
  brightness at the center of each pixel.  This is what all other profiles do,
  but had not been what a Box or Pixel did. (#639)
- Fixed a bug where InterpolatedImage and Box profiles were not correctly
  rendered when transformed by something that includes a flip. (#645)
- Fixed a bug in rendering profiles that involve two separate shifts. (#645)
- Fixed a bug if drawImage was given odd nx, ny parameters, the drawn profile
  was not correctly centered in the image. (#645)


Updates to config options
-------------------------

- Added TopHat type. (#639)

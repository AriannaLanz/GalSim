    Class.__doc__ = """A class for representing 2D positions on the plane.

    PositionD describes positions with floating point values in `x` and `y`.
    PositionI described positions with integer values in `x` and `y`.

    Initialization
    --------------

    For the float-valued position class, example initializations include:

        pos = galsim.PositionD(x=0.5, y=-0.5)
        pos = galsim.PositionD(0.5, -0.5)

    And for the integer-valued position class, example initializations include:

        pos = galsim.PositionI(x=45, y=13)
        pos = galsim.PositionI(45, 13)

    Attributes
    ----------
    For an instance `pos` as instantiated above, `pos.x` and `pos.y` store the x and y values of the
    position.

    Arithmetic
    ----------
    Most arithmetic that makes sense for a position is allowed:

        pos1 + pos2
        pos1 - pos2
        pos * x
        pos / x
        -pos
        pos1 += pos2
        pos1 -= pos2
        pos *= x
        pos -= x

    Note though that the types generally need to match.  For example, you cannot multiply
    a PositionI by a float or add a PositionI to a PositionD.

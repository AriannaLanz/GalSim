    - sigma_draw: moments_sigma from adaptive moments on a GSObject image rendered using .draw()

    - delta_g1obs: estimated mean difference between i) observed_shape.g1 from images of the same
      GSObject rendered with .drawShoot(), and ii) `g1obs_draw`.

    - delta_g2obs: estimated mean difference between i) observed_shape.g2 from images of the same
      GSObject rendered with .drawShoot(), and ii) `g1obs_draw`.

    - delta_sigma: estimated mean difference between i) moments_sigma from images of the same
      GSObject rendered with .drawShoot(), and ii) `sigma_draw`.

    - err_g1obs: standard error in `delta_g1obs` estimated from the test sample.

    - err_g2obs: standard error in `delta_g2obs` estimated from the test sample.

    - err_sigma: standard error in `delta_sigma` estimated from the test sample.

    - gsobject: the galsim.GSObject for which this test was performed (prior to PSF convolution if
      a PSF was also supplied).

    - psf_object: the optional additional PSF supplied by the user for tests of convolved objects,
      will be `None` if not used.

    - imsize: the size of the  images tested - all test images are currently square.

    - dx: the pixel scale in the images tested.

    - wmult: the `wmult` parameter used in .draw() (see the GSObject .draw() method docs for more
      details).

    - n_iterations: number of iterations of `n_trials` trials required to get delta quantities to
      the above accuracy.

    - n_trials_per_iter: number of trial images of used to estimate or successively re-estimate the
      standard error on the delta quantities above for each iteration.

    - n_photons_per_trial: number of photons shot in drawShoot() for each trial.

    - time: the time taken to perform the test.

    Note this is really only a simple storage container for the results above.  All of the
    non trivial calculation is completed before a ComparisonShapeData instance is initialized,
    typically in the function compare_object_dft_vs_photon.

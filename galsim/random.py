_galsim.BaseDeviate.__doc__ = """
Base class for all the various random deviates.

This holds the essential random number generator that all the other classes use.

All deviates have three constructors that define different ways of setting up the random number
generator.

  1) Only the arguments particular to the derived class (e.g. mean and sigma for GaussianDeviate).
     In this case, a new random number generator is created and it is seeded using the computer's
     microsecond counter.

  2) Using a particular seed as the first argument to the constructor.
     This will also create a new random number generator, but seed it with the provided value.

  3) Passing another BaseDeviate as the first arguemnt to the constructor.
     This will make the new Deviate share the same underlying random number generator with the other
     Deviate.  So you can make one Deviate (of any type), and seed it with a particular
     deterministic value.  Then if you pass that Deviate to any other one you make, they will all be
     using the same rng and have a particular deterministic series of values.  (It doesn't have to
     be the first one -- any one you've made later can also be used to seed a new one.)
     
There is not much you can do with something that is only known to be a BaseDeviate rather than one
of the derived classes other than construct it and change the seed, and use it as an argument to
pass to other Deviate constructors.

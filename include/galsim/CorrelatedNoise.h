 * It's Mike's way to have debug statements in the code that are really easy to turn on and off.
 *
 * If DEBUGLOGGING is #defined, then these write out to *dbgout, according to the value of

 * dbg requires verbose_level >= 1
 * xdbg requires verbose_level >= 2

 * If DEBUGLOGGING is not defined, the all three becomes just `if (false) std::cerr`,

     * being mainly for visualization/checking purposes, we go via the TMV intermediary to avoid
     * code duplication.  If, in future, it becomes critical to speed up this function this can be
     * revisited.
